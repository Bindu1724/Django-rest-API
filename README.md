# Django-rest-API

Django REST API is a powerful tool for building APIs in Python using Django. It allows you to define endpoints, handle requests, and serialize data into JSON format efficiently. 

##Steps to Create a Django REST API Project:
1. Set Up Your Environment:
   Install Python and django on your system.
   Use  to include Django REST Framework, which simplifies API development

2. Create a Django Project:
   Run ==django admin startproject <project_name>== to create a project.
   Here I used "mysite" as a project_name.
   Navigate into the project folder: cd <project_name>.

3. Create a Django App:
   Inside yur project, create an app where your api logic is live : python manage.py startapp <app_name>.
   Here api is the app name.
